# Deployment Error Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. React Window Import Error
**Problem**: `FixedSizeList` is not exported from 'react-window'
**Solution**: Changed import from `FixedSizeList as List` to `FixedSizeList` directly

### 2. Next.js 15 Params Type Error
**Problem**: `params` should be `Promise<any>` in Next.js 15
**Solution**: Updated `AgendaPageProps` interface to use `Promise<{ id: string }>` and added `await params` resolution

### 3. Edge Runtime Compatibility
**Problem**: Supabase realtime uses Node.js APIs not supported in Edge Runtime
**Solution**: 
- Disabled realtime in middleware Supabase client
- Disabled auth auto-refresh in middleware for performance
- Added CSP headers for security

## Performance Improvements

### N+1 Query Problem
The debug logs showed individual vote fetching for each agenda item (21-27 separate calls). This has been addressed through:
- Batch API endpoints for vote data
- Materialized views for common queries
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns

### Connection Pooling
- Configured pgBouncer settings for production
- Added connection monitoring endpoints
- Implemented query timeout limits

## Security Enhancements

### Edge Runtime Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Content-Security-Policy with Supabase domains
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Database Security
- Enhanced RLS policies for all user-facing tables
- Admin-only access controls
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Enable pgBouncer** in Supabase dashboard under Settings > Database
2. **Verify Environment Variables** in Vercel project settings:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` should point to production domain
   - All Supabase keys properly scoped (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client, server-only for service role)

## Monitoring

- Connection pool monitoring via `/api/admin/connection-monitor`
- Security audit endpoint at `/api/admin/security-audit`
- Performance metrics tracking in production logs
